# LiveJournal Crosspost, Reborn

When MovableType 4 had just been released, I sat down and hacked together a plugin to crosspost entries to LiveJournal.

This project is an attempt to do it (more) correctly and migrate to MovableType 5, now that there is mature plugin developer documentation.

**NOTE:** After I was most of the way done with the first pass at this plugin, I came across [CrossPoster](http://plugins.movalog.com/crossposter/). It is likely to be more full-featured than what I have here. However the license terms were vague on what constitutes “Commercial Use,” and we needed this for [The Slackers’ Network](http://www.slackers.net), so I kept at it.

It also now appears that CrossPoster hasn’t been updated since then (it is still in public beta), so perhaps I made the correct choice. Probably not, though.
